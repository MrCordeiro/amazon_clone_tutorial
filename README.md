# amazon_clone_tutorial

As of any Flutter project, this one was created with the IDE's "Create new Flutter project option".

Database located at: cloud.mongodb.com

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Development

Start server:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

## Admin screen

There is currently no link to the admin section and back. Instead, users are redirected automatically based on the user's role.

To change a user's role between `user` and `admin`, modify the database directly (yeah yeah, this is a tutorial app; suck it up).
